# Automations is a necessary evil, in the space of head to head competition being able to automate your work is a huge advantage.

I was recently asked by a friend if I could help him get more likes on tinder and okcupid, after giving him a brief lecture about the importance of independence and suggesting him a few books on stoicism, I started making a script which could auto like profiles on tinder and Okcupid and also left swipe users based on keywords in the Bio. I hope this would really help the boys. Paired with a gold account, this strategy will make you blow up!

# Usage

Clone the project and cd

- Log into the tinder or okcupid website
- depending on the website, choose
    
     [https://tinder.com/app/recs](https://tinder.com/app/recs) or to [https://www.okcupid.com/doubletake](https://www.okcupid.com/doubletake)
    
- Open the browser's console
- Copy and paste the code from dating_bro.js to console
- Run the script
